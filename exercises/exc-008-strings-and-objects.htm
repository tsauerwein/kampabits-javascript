					Below, two class constructors are defined: Student and School.
					A Student object has a name and an array of courses the student 
					is attending. A School object has an array of students and two methods. 
					The method "addStudent(student)" is used to add students to the
					school. The method "findStudentsByCourse(course)" prints the
					names of all students that attend the given course.

					Your job is to implement the method "findStudentsByCourse(course)".

					For example:

						school.findStudentsByCourse("HTML") should print: "John, Jenny"
						school.findStudentsByCourse("CSS") should print: "Jenny"
						school.findStudentsByCourse("JavaScript") should print: "Peter"
						school.findStudentsByCourse("OOP") should print: ""

					We are going to write an address book. An address book
					has a list of contacts. A contact has the attributes name
					and email.
					
					First, your job is to write the Contact constructor.
					Then, you will have to implement the method "addContact(contact)"
					in AddressBook, which adds a contact to the address book.
					Next, the method "findByName(name)" has to implemented, which
					prints all contacts with the given name.

					For example:
						addressBook.findByName("Peter") should print "Peter (peter@gmail.com)"
						addressBook.findByName("Lucy") should print "Lucy (lucy@gmail.com)"
						addressBook.findByName("Bob") should print "Bob can not be found"

					this.addContact =  function(contact) {
