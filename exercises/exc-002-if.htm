				Exercise:

				Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers. Show the larger number of the two in a message. If the two numbers are equal, tell the user.
				Remember to use Number() to convert the user input into a number. 

				"Please enter a first number" -> 4
				"Please enter a second number" -> 6
				"The second number is larger: 6 > 4"

				"Please enter a first number" -> 4
				"Please enter a second number" -> 4
				"The two numbers are equal."
